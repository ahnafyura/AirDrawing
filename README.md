# 🚀 Virtual Gesture Studio (Advanced Air Painter)

Welcome to **Virtual Gesture Studio**! This is an advanced computer vision application that transforms your webcam into an interactive digital canvas. Forget your mouse and keyboard — draw, design, and manage your artwork using only hand gestures.

This project leverages **OpenCV** for real-time image processing and **Google MediaPipe** for precise 21-point hand landmark detection, supporting intuitive two-hand control.

*(Tip: Replace this with your own demo GIF!)*

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Dual-Hand Control

* **Left Hand**: Acts as the *Tool Palette* (mode selection).
* **Right Hand**: Acts as the *Brush* (for drawing).

### 🧠 Smart Mode System

| Mode       | Description                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **DRAW**   | Freestyle drawing on the canvas.                 |
| **SHAPE**  | Instantly draw rectangles.                       |
| **PICKER** | Opens a 15-color palette for selection.          |
| **CURSOR** | Idle mode for moving the cursor without drawing. |

### 🖼️ Full Canvas Management

* **Undo**: Revert up to 10 recent actions (canvas history).
* **Clear**: Wipe the entire canvas (hold 1 second for confirmation).
* **Save**: Save your artwork to the *HasilKarya/* folder (hold 1 second).

### 🖌️ Dynamic Brush & Eraser

* **Brush Size**: Adjust dynamically by changing the distance between your right-hand index and pinky fingers.
* **Eraser**: Dedicated UI button for a large eraser mode.

### 💡 Interactive UI (Header)

* Shows active color preview.
* Displays brush size (SIZE).
* Temporary notifications (e.g., *“SAVED!”*).

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage Guide

### 1️⃣ Initial Setup

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahnafyura/AirDrawing.git
cd AirDrawing
```

### 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

Using a virtual environment is recommended for dependency isolation.

```bash
# Create venv
python -m venv venv

# Activate (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate (macOS/Linux)
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Application

Make sure your Python file is named `app.py` (or adjust the command):

```bash
python your_file_name.py
```

The app will open a webcam window — you’re ready to paint with your hands!
